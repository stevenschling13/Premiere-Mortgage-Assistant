# Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
- Do not create a public issue.
- Open a private security issue on GitHub or contact the maintainers via GitHub.
- Provide reproducible steps, impact, and suggested mitigations.

Handling of PII:
- PII must be masked in logs and never committed.
- Use environment-backed secrets and encryption at rest.
